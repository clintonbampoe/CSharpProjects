## HABIT LOGGER PROJECT
---

This is the first Console App I'm building that's outside my comfort zone.
There are some skills I would need to build this that I don't have yet. But in all,
I think this would be a great learning experience.

### REQUIREMENTS
- This is an application that logs occurences of a habit
- This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. number of glasses a day)
- Users need to be able to input the date of the occurence of the habit
- The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database,
	if one isn't present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- It should handle all possible errors so the application never crashes
- It only interacts with the database using ADO.NET
- I'll try my best to follow the `DRY`,	`KISS` and `SOLID` principles


### TIPS
- To improve UX, when asking for a date input, it should give an option to type
	a single command to add today's date;
- DO NOT CREATE A TABLE FOR EACH HABIT

Lowkey this isn't going to be easy 😫
